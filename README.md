## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcrypt
- body-parser
- cookie-session


## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.

### Things to note

- Behaviour requirement titles(ie. GET /urls, POST /urls/:id) are searchable and commented above each route

- Random Button: Hidden next to register button on navbar. Becuase why not. You were adventurous enough to try and find a page that doesnt exist. Why not randomly go somewhere that does?
